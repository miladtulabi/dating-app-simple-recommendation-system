# dating-app-simple-recommendation-system

Hello everyone!

in this simple and short code, we have a recommendation system based on MBTI personality test!

It means that request user, does the MBTI test (not provided here) and the her results show that which is her personality.

There are studies showing each personality matches with what other personalites!

with another simplification I made to the dataset, there is only two personalities which any one of this two has a rank (1 and 2).

there are two other columns in the dataset, gender and city of other users.

for another simplification, I filter out other users with other cities than request user and also request user preffered male match and 2-year age differences.

and finally, we made a recommendation table with score values, which we can filter highest scores users and show them to request user!
